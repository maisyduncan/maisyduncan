- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maisyduncan, a 22 year old Network Security Engineer living in Tring.

- ðŸŒ± Assisted by SheCodes, Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, in order to develop an understanding of the fundamentals of coding. My first project will involve using these languages to create a website which will serve as my virtual CV.

- ðŸ‘€ After making some headway on my first project, Iâ€™ll be looking to learn Python, in order to take my career in the direction of scripting and automation.

- ðŸ“« Reach out to me on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/maisyduncan/
